<p>GHCup was asked to install a given version of a tool, but the file could not be verified. E.g.:</p>

<p>There can be a number of reasons for this. If you have GHCup caching enabled, try to delete the file, e.g. in the above case:</p>
<pre><code>rm /home/hasufell/.ghcup/cache/ghc-9.0.2-x86_64-fedora27-linux.tar.xz</code></pre>
<p>Then try to install again.</p>
<p>If the problem persists or you don’t have caching enabled, it’s possible that you are having network issues.
You can try to switch the downloader and see if that helps, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>ghcup --downloader=wget install ghc 9.0.2</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise the file may simply be corrupted or the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata">GHCup metadata</a> incorrect.
In that case, raise an issue <a href="https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/issues">here</a>.</p>
