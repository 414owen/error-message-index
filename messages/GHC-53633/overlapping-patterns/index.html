<pre><code>Overlapping.hs:5:1: warning: [GHC-53633] [-Woverlapping-patterns]
    Pattern match is redundant
    In an equation for ‘f’: f (Just _) = ...
  |
5 | f (Just _) = False
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</code></pre>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>The definition of <code>f</code> contains two separate patterns that both match <code>(Just _)</code>. This usually indicates a bug, because the second one would be unreachable. This can be fixed by removing the redundant case, but it usually indicates that a change to the program was made quickly and demands more thought.</p>
