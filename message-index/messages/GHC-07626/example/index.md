title: Parse error in pattern
---

This error occurs because we havenâ€™t properly pattern matched on the list in our definition of the `merge` function. In particular, the parentheses are missing. The type here is a list, which means our options are to match on either the empty list, `[]`, or a list with head and tail, `(a:as)`. By omitting the parentheses around `a:as`, the compiler reads this as an argument, `a`, followed by a misplaced infix cons `(:)` operator, rather than considering the `:` to be part of the list being matched.
