title: Parse error in pattern
---

This error occurs because we havenâ€™t properly pattern matched on the list in our definition of the merge function. The type here is a list, which means our options are to match on either the empty list, [], or a list with head and tail, (a:as). By omitting the parentheses around a:as, the compiler reads this as an argument, a, followed by a misplaced infix cons (:) operator.
