<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  This site describes the various messages that can be returned by
  GHC, the most-commonly-used Haskell implementation, including both errors and warnings. Beginning with version
  X.Y.Z, GHC emits a code with the format <code>[GHC-123]</code> for each
  message. These codes can be looked up below for further information.
</p>

<p>
  If you encounter a message that is not yet documented, please
  <a href="http://github.com/haskellfoundation/message-index/issues">open an issue</a> or
  <a href="http://github.com/haskellfoundation/message-index/pulls">submit a pull request with documentation</a>.
  Pull requests with additional examples and improved explanations for
  existing messages are also very welcome.
</p>
