# The Haskell Message Index
[![.github/workflows/deploy.yml](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/error-message-index/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

**View the site â†’** https://errors.haskell.org/

Haskell tooling emits a variety of errors, warnings, and other messages. In recent versions, some of these tools emit a unique code for each message that allows it to be identified. This site allows these codes to be looked up, providing examples, context, and further information that can make them easier to understand.

## Supported Tools

Today, the Haskell Message Index supports three tools. Any user-facing Haskell-related programming tools are welcome to join the effort!

| Tool  | Earliest supported version | Namespace |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------|
| GHC   | 9.6.1                      | `GHC-`    |
| Stack | 2.9.3                      | `S-`      |
| GHCup | 0.1.19.0                   | `GHCup-`  |

## Contributing to the Message Index

Contributions may come in the form of changes to the code base, as well as opening or commenting on issues and pull requests. You are warmly invited to participate!

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on improving the site. Thanks!

If you're a Haskell tool developer who would like to integrate your project with the site, please refer to [tool-developers.md](./tool-developers.md) for recommendations regarding the error codes themselves.

## Running Locally

The site is built with the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site generator. To view the site locally, enter the `message-index` directory and run:
```console
$ cabal run -- site watch
```
or
```console
$ stack run -- site watch
```
which fires up an HTTP server on `localhost:8000`.

The error messages:
```
cabal: There is no <pkgname>.cabal package file or cabal.project file. To
build packages locally you need at minimum a <pkgname>.cabal file. You can use
'cabal init' to create one.

For non-trivial projects you will also want a cabal.project file in the root
directory of your project. This file lists the packages in your project and
all other build configuration. See the Cabal user guide for full details.
```
and
```
No executables found.
```
typically indicate that the site was started from the root of the repository, rather than the `message-index` directory.

## Maintenance

The Message Index is a project of the [Haskell Foundation](http://haskell.foundation). Please get in touch if you have ideas, requests, or any other feedback!
