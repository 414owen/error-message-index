# Technology choices

The website generated by `message-index` uses a few JS components.

 - [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for highlighting blocks of code. [License: BSD 3-Clause](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/LICENSE).
 - [TableFilter](http://www.tablefilter.com/) for the filtering functionality in the error message table. [License: MIT](https://github.com/koalyptus/TableFilter/blob/master/LICENSE).

Generally speaking, we choose technology for this site based on the following criteria:

 * The build process for the site should be simple, relying on no build tools or package managers aside from `cabal` or `stack`
 * CSS and Javascript code should be straightforward to maintain by someone who has only rudimentary front-end development skills
 * The generated site should consist only of static files that can be hosted anywhere
 * URLs should be predictable, and easy for external tools to generate (e.g. so IDEs can link to error documentation)
